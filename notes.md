# To Do

- Have built ml-boilerplate as a python package
- Need to upload to pypi so I can use in the logic script here
- Need to figure out where I'm going to save the training model. Might be best to
save it in a local dir and then reference the location in the POST request
- Then i can just pull that out when I need to do a prediction
- Business logic following POST of user input returning the results
